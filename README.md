# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Michael Tanjuakio**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Debug-a-thon** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes! 
It is able to display a simple Hello World print, print what 2 + 2 is, show random colors, show a list, and display my favorite number!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🐛❌🛠️**

## Notes

Learning the logcat was a great experience. It helps me trace the code to find the error.
This was a pretty simple project all things considered, and it helped me navigate errors
and figuring out how to debug and fix them to get the corrected output.

Current Day in the gif is March 4, 2024: prints out 4

My favorite number: my favorite number is 7!
